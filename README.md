# Kickstarting with Excel - Module 1 Challenge
<sub>UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics Bootcamp</sub>

## Overview of Project
An analysis of past Kickstarter campaigns and their rates of success and failure with a focus in the theater category and play subcategory. The client, Louise, intends to launch a Kickstarter campaign to fund her play, "Fever." With a budget of over $10,000, she wants to increase her chance of a successful campaign with the information gathered from the dataset. Using the data from previous Kickstarters, the aim is to use Excel to analyze the factors of success and failure and provide advice on a new project based on historical data and outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
The majority of analysis was completed through the use of pivot tables and charts. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

By comparing the outcomes of theater Kickstarters to the month in which they were launched, it can be concluded that campaigns are more likely to succeed in May, June, and July, with May being the best launch month. The worst month to launch a theater Kickstarter is December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

By comparing the fundraising goals of play Kickstarters to the rates of success and failure, the campaigns most likely to succeed had a goal of less than $1,000. The goals most likely to fail are from $25,000 to $35,000 and above $40,000. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While completing the exercise, I encountered few snags, but several issues could be found in similar datasets. Because of the generally messy nature of data, errors within the datasets are common, whether from missing, incorrectly-typed, or mixed variables. Also, if a person goes into an analysis project without knowing exactly what they are looking for and which specific areas of data they want to analyze, they will face several hurdles.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the outcomes based on launch date?
    - Based on the launch date, campaigns are most likely to be successful in May and June. Campaigns most likely to fail are October and December, where the rate of success is nearly the same as the rate of failure.
- What can you conclude about the outcomes based on goals?
    - For outcomes based on goals, the campaigns most lkely to succeed had a goal of less than $1,000, and the overall rate of success to failure is 47% to 53%, making this campaign type less likely to succeed than it is to fail.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - Although this dataset has increased our understanding of some aspects of Kickstarter campaigns and the factors that affect their success rate, it is still limited. The dataset itself was quite small once it was narrowed down to the specific type of Kickstarter the client wanted. There was also no information given as to why specific Kickstarters failed - was it because it took too long to create the final product? Was not enough money raised? Was the goal changed? More information would create a more complete picture, and lead to more accurate analysis.
- What are some other possible talbes and/or graphs that we could create?
    - We could use the current dataset to divide theater plays by the country they were launched in, and compare success rates across months. With more data, the Kickstarters' genres could also be gathered, compared, and analyzed for different patterns rather than the average of all theater-based plays.
